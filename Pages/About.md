**This blog is where I post lengthy articles about fiction. Enjoy and please share your thoughts!**

*A few boring notes about me and what I write:*

I'm the kind of person who gets really into a few stories and try to experience them over and over, and in-depth. I basically walk around talking to myself. So at one point, I just started writing it down. I try to make my texts formal and well written, while still doing it mostly free form rather than essays. Usually, I just want to express myself more than make a point. I'll add some flavor here and there because I enjoy it.

The articles themselves are mostly analysis and philosophical tangents. There will probably also be speculation, critique, bullet lists, random notes, fanfiction and poor attempts at humor.

Hopefully you'll get something out of it, maybe enjoyment, maybe distress, but beyond that matter to discuss, to agree and disagree with, or to expand upon. If you manage to read me to the end, please discuss and share what you think. The only thing I ask is to be kind and respectful, and to try to be constructive in your arguments.

**Cheers!**
