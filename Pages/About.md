Hello there, you somehow stumbled onto my blog.

Writing is a hobby of mine to record and expand on all the stuff that's going around in my head all the time.

I'm the kind of person who gets really into a few stories and try to experience them over and over, and in-depth. I basically walk around talking to myself. So at one point, I just started writing it down. I try to make my texts formal and well written, while still doing it mostly free form rather than essays. Usually, I just want to express myself more than make a point. A lot of it is very subjective and matter of interpretation. There is some flavor thrown in there because I enjoy it.

The articles themselves are mostly streams of thought formulated as analysis and philosophical tangents. There will be speculation, critique, bullet lists, random notes, fanfiction and poor attempts at humor. Topics are either general or specific to one fiction, to reduce spoilers and avoid direct comparisons between media.

I often post on Reddit to get more visibility and feedback. My very secret alias is Sinheldrin, but keep it quiet!

Hopefully you'll get something out of it, maybe enjoyment, maybe distress, but beyond that matter to discuss, to agree and disagree with, or to expand upon. If you manage to read me to the end, please discuss and share what you think. The only thing I ask is to be kind and respectful, and to try to be constructive in your arguments.

**Cheers!**
